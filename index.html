    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Hamzeh and I’m a Senior at Lewis University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I was born in Dallas, Texas but grew up in Saudi Arabia with my family. 
        At the age of 17 I moved to the US to get my degree and continue my journey of making it in life. 
        I enjoy going to the gym, cooking, and playing soccer with friends whenever I have free time. I currently work full time and go to school full while trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
